# DEEP-LEARNING-IMAGE-CLASSIFIER

In this first part of the project, you'll work through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with PyTorch.
Now that you've built and trained a deep neural network on the flower data set, it's time to convert it into an 
application that others can use. 
Your application should be a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line. 
For testing, you should use the checkpoint you saved in the first part.
